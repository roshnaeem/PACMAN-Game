## Features
- It is a maze chase video game.
- The objective of the game is to eat all of the dots placed in the maze while avoiding the colored ghosts.
- Two ghosts, Blinky and Inky roam the maze, trying to catch Pac-Man - if a ghost touches him, he is dead.
- One more thing is that ghosts also eat Pac dots so player has to move fast and eat dots before ghosts to score more. 
- Score is shown at the top of maze.
